      Identity theft is a crime of fraud wherein criminals portray as other individuals. Most of the time,
      it is for financial gain. Criminals are able to get another person’s credentials and sensitive
      information through the malwares that have been installed in the system.
      <br><br>Aside from protecting yourself from malware, additional steps can be taken to prevent identity
      theft.  Users should protect their personal information. Do not give out information where you are
      unsure of where it will be used. During online transactions, take time to review the website’s
      privacy policy. Be sure that the website offers secure data encryption and other services so that
      they could protect your information.
      <br><br>If and when you suspect that you are a victim of identity theft, it is important to
      place fraud alerts on your credit cards and file police reports.
