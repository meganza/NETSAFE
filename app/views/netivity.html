        A digital tattoo represents all the information a user posts online. Photos, text, comments, or other forms of media posted by a user is permanently on the internet even if it was deleted. An internet user’s digital tattoo can also be called a digital footprint. A person’s digital tattoo will affect the person’s reputation especially since companies tend to do research on the background of the people they employ. According to Marie Cooney (n.d.), there are five things you should ask before you post:

        <br><br>
        <b>1.  What do I look like?</b>
        <blockquote> It is important to keep in mind the impression an internet user might
        leave upon other internet users, considering that that other internet user might be a
        university or even a company the internet user might be trying to impress.
        </blockquote>

        <b>2.  Is this “ink” permanent?</b>
        <blockquote> A post online is forever in a way that if one thinks that they have already
        deleted a post, there is still no guarantee that someone else might have already copied or
        downloaded it. One should always remember that it is easy for other people to copy what an
        internet user shares online, change it, and share it without the internet user knowing.
        </blockquote>

        <b>3.  Am I giving away too much?</b>
        <blockquote> The more information you share, the more people can learn about you, and the
        more people learn about you, the more they could use the information against you.
        </blockquote>

        <b>4.  Would I want this shared about me?</b>
        <blockquote> For instance, a netizen shares a picture of their friend online. It is only
        right that the netizen ask permission to their friend if they would want their photo posted.
        </blockquote>

        <b>5.  Does it pass the billboard test?</b>
        <blockquote> Before you post something online, think: would you be happy to see what you
        posted on a billboard where the rest of your parents, your grandparents, your neighbors
        could see it? If not, do you really want to share it?

        <b>Internet Privacy</b> is the level of security and privacy of personal information of an individual.
        Internet privacy refers to multiple techniques and technologies used to protect data. It is also
        known as online privacy. Internet privacy is a great concern when it comes to online transactions,
        the use of social media, visiting online forums and playing online games. If a person’s internet
        privacy is compromised, the person might fall victim to cyber attacks like identity theft.
        To avoid risks on internet privacy, use protective software like anti- viruses and firewalls.
        When shopping, avoid untrusted websites. One should also avoid going to websites with low security
        always use strong passwords that consist of numbers, letters and special characters.

        <h4><b>Remember the human</b></h4>
        <blockquote> This rule is similar to the expression “Do unto others as you’d have others do unto you”.
        Communicating with others using an electronic device limits the person to only using words.
        Communication in the form limits the person from using facial expressions, gestures and the tone
        of their voice. This concept applies to both sides of the conversation. Because of this limitation,
        misinterpretation could easily happen when communicating via chat, email or posting in discussion
        groups. A person only sees a computer screen when doing this form of communication; because of this,
        the person could have a tendency of forgetting that their recipient is a human too. People can express
        themselves freely and explore what the internet has to offer but one should remember that they are
        interacting with other people as well. <br>
        A good practice when conversing online is to ask the question “Would you say it to the person’s face?”
        If the answer to the question is no then the person should think about rewriting and rereading what
        they have to say until they feel comfortable about what they are about to send.

        <blockquote>In real life, people follow the law because you can easily get caught.
        In cyberspace, crime seems to happen more often because it’s a lot harder to track people down.
        Some people forget that there are also people on the other side of the screen and that poor
        ethics is more acceptable in the cyber world. This is a common misconception. The standard of
        behavior for real life and cyberspace are different but they hold equal consequences.
        Doing illegal actions in cyberspace is bad netiquette. Just because it’s harder to get caught
        does not mean that it’s okay.

        websites could be okay in their domain but it might not be acceptable behavior in other domains.
        Posting rumors could be okay in personal blogs but it’s not okay to post that in news forums.
        If a person is new to the domain they must first look around and browse what’s in the domain
        and how the people act in the domain. This will give the person an idea as to how to participate.

      <div id="tab-help-content-7" class="tab-help-content">
        <h4><b>Respect other people’s time and bandwidth</b></h4>
        <blockquote>People only have limited time. When sending emails or posting in discussion forums or
        groups, it is the responsibility of the person to ensure that the content they are posting or sending
        is worth the time of the reader. Bandwidth is the amount of information that can be carried by wires
        and channels that connect people in cyberspace. Sending messages and uploading content also take up
        bandwidth. Posting a similar comment multiple time not only wastes the time of others but also
        wastes bandwidth. <br>
        A reminder for this rule is that no one is the center of cyberspace. One should not expect that
        others will instantaneously respond to your questions and concerns. It is also important to remember
        that not everyone will agree to what a person has to say no matter how much effort the person has
        put in making that post or comment. <br>
        One more idea to think about before posting is who actually needs to read the message.
        It is easy to send a message to multiple people with the technology we have today and people tend to
        forget to think about the time they are taking up from the person. If another person does not
        necessarily need to see the message, then there is no need to send it to them. Only send it to
        who actually needs it.

        <h4><b>Make yourself look good online</b></h4>
        <blockquote> When a person is communicating online, it is important for them to know what
        they are talking about. Posting bad information could easily spread in the internet and is
        open to interpretation to others. People cannot control what others do with the content they
        put out but it is their responsibility to keep the posts they make themselves as accurate as
        possible in order to avoid poor interpretation. It is also important to make sure that messages
        a person posts online are logical and grammatically correct. A good way to do this is to keep it
        simple. People tend to use long words in order to give a good impression but it tends to lead to
        the message not making any sense at all. Lastly, people should not use offensive language. Swearing
        is also not acceptable online. People could do it but it will not do anyone any good.

        <h4><b>Share expert knowledge</b></h4>
        <blockquote> One advantage to cyberspace is the array of people that others can communicate to.
        Many of these people can provide answers to questions of their expertise. This is a reason why
        people tend to ask a lot of questions online. The internet grew because people wanted to share
        information. <br>
        A good tip is for people to share the information that they have in order to help others.
        This will help the community grow.<br>
        If a question has been answered, it is also a good idea to share the results so others can see
        what people have to say about the question. It’s a good idea to write a summary of the results
        to make it easier for others to read about the information that have been gathered. If a person
        is not an expert on content themselves, they could always post reliable resources where people
        could look into. <br>

        <h4><b>Help keep flame wars under control</b></h4>
        <blockquote> Flaming is when people express their opinions without holding back their emotions.
        Netiquette does not necessarily forbid flaming because flames are entertaining for the most part
        and most of the time, the recipients of these flames deserve it. Even so, netiquette does allow
        prolonged flame wars where people send continuous angry text to one another that destroy the
        camaraderie of the people in the discussion group. Flaming could be entertaining but it gets
        dull as it progresses longer especially if the person reading is uninvolved.

        <h4><b>Respect other people’s privacy</b></h4>
        <blockquote> This rule is straightforward and has the same application as to how a person
        should respect another person’s privacy in real life. Don’t read other people’s personal
        messages or emails. If the person reading is not the recipient then they are practicing bad
        netiquette. People should not access information that is not meant to be public or not meant for
        them to read.

        <blockquote> Some people have higher access online such as system administrators, developers or
        admins of Multi-user dungeons (MUDs), and experts in every office. Knowing more or having more access
        online does not give a person the right to abuse it. For example, system admins should never read
        private emails of employees.

        <h4><b>Be forgiving of other people’s mistakes</b></h4>
        <blockquote> When someone makes a mistake online, whether misspelled words, grammatical errors,
        unnecessarily long answer or unintelligent questions, be kind about it. If one  decides to inform
        someone of his/her mistake, he or she must do it politely, and preferably by private email or
        messages rather than in public. It is also advised to think twice before reacting.
