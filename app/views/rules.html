          Bob needs to get the details for a project from his co-worker as soon as possible.
          He consistently messaged the his co-worker through e-mail regarding the similar
          content throughout the day. Eventually, he kept messaging him through facebook with
          obscene text out of anger. He did not realize that the co-worker was busy with his own work.
          Eventually, he was able to receive the information he needed but the co-worker is annoyed by
          Bob and he regrets spamming him.
