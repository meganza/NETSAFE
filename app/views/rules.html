      <b>1.  Remember the human</b>
      <blockquote> This rule is similar to the expression “Do unto others as you’d have others do unto you”.
      Communicating with others using an electronic device limits the person to only using words.
      Communication in the form limits the person from using facial expressions, gestures and the tone
      of their voice. This concept applies to both sides of the conversation. Because of this limitation,
      misinterpretation could easily happen when communicating via chat, email or posting in discussion
      groups. A person only sees a computer screen when doing this form of communication; because of this,
      the person could have a tendency of forgetting that their recipient is a human too. People can express
      themselves freely and explore what the internet has to offer but one should remember that they are
      interacting with other people as well. <br>
      A good practice when conversing online is to ask the question “Would you say it to the person’s face?”
      If the answer to the question is no then the person should think about rewriting and rereading what
      they have to say until they feel comfortable about what they are about to send.
      </blockquote>

      <b>2.  Adhere the same standards of behavior online that you follow in real life</b>
      <blockquote>In real life, people follow the law because you can easily get caught.
      In cyberspace, crime seems to happen more often because it’s a lot harder to track people down.
      Some people forget that there are also people on the other side of the screen and that poor
      ethics is more acceptable in the cyber world. This is a common misconception. The standard of
      behavior for real life and cyberspace are different but they hold equal consequences.
      Doing illegal actions in cyberspace is bad netiquette. Just because it’s harder to get caught
      does not mean that it’s okay.
      </blockquote>

      <b>3.  Know where you are in cyberspace </b>
      <blockquote> Netiquette will vary depending on your domain. The actions a person does in some
      websites could be okay in their domain but it might not be acceptable behavior in other domains.
      Posting rumors could be okay in personal blogs but it’s not okay to post that in news forums.
      If a person is new to the domain they must first look around and browse what’s in the domain
      and how the people act in the domain. This will give the person an idea as to how to participate.
      </blockquote>

      <b>4.  Respect other people’s time and bandwidth</b>
      <blockquote>People only have limited time. When sending emails or posting in discussion forums or
      groups, it is the responsibility of the person to ensure that the content they are posting or sending
      is worth the time of the reader. Bandwidth is the amount of information that can be carried by wires
      and channels that connect people in cyberspace. Sending messages and uploading content also take up
      bandwidth. Posting a similar comment multiple time not only wastes the time of others but also
      wastes bandwidth. <br>
      A reminder for this rule is that no one is the center of cyberspace. One should not expect that
      others will instantaneously respond to your questions and concerns. It is also important to remember
      that not everyone will agree to what a person has to say no matter how much effort the person has
      put in making that post or comment. <br>
      One more idea to think about before posting is who actually needs to read the message.
      It is easy to send a message to multiple people with the technology we have today and people tend to
      forget to think about the time they are taking up from the person. If another person does not
      necessarily need to see the message, then there is no need to send it to them. Only send it to
      who actually needs it.
      </blockquote>

      <b>5.  Make yourself look good online</b>
      <blockquote> When a person is communicating online, it is important for them to know what
      they are talking about. Posting bad information could easily spread in the internet and is
      open to interpretation to others. People cannot control what others do with the content they
      put out but it is their responsibility to keep the posts they make themselves as accurate as
      possible in order to avoid poor interpretation. It is also important to make sure that messages
      a person posts online are logical and grammatically correct. A good way to do this is to keep it
      simple. People tend to use long words in order to give a good impression but it tends to lead to
      the message not making any sense at all. Lastly, people should not use offensive language. Swearing
      is also not acceptable online. People could do it but it will not do anyone any good.
      </blockquote>

      <b>6.  Share expert knowledge</b>
      <blockquote> One advantage to cyberspace is the array of people that others can communicate to.
      Many of these people can provide answers to questions of their expertise. This is a reason why
      people tend to ask a lot of questions online. The internet grew because people wanted to share
      information. <br>
      A good tip is for people to share the information that they have in order to help others.
      This will help the community grow.<br>
      If a question has been answered, it is also a good idea to share the results so others can see
      what people have to say about the question. It’s a good idea to write a summary of the results
      to make it easier for others to read about the information that have been gathered. If a person
      is not an expert on content themselves, they could always post reliable resources where people
      could look into. <br>
      </blockquote>

      <b> 7.  Help keep flame wars under control</b>
      <blockquote> Flaming is when people express their opinions without holding back their emotions.
      Netiquette does not necessarily forbid flaming because flames are entertaining for the most part
      and most of the time, the recipients of these flames deserve it. Even so, netiquette does allow
      prolonged flame wars where people send continuous angry text to one another that destroy the
      camaraderie of the people in the discussion group. Flaming could be entertaining but it gets
      dull as it progresses longer especially if the person reading is uninvolved.
      </blockquote>

      <b>8.  Respect other people’s privacy</b>
      <blockquote> This rule is straightforward and has the same application as to how a person
      should respect another person’s privacy in real life. Don’t read other people’s personal
      messages or emails. If the person reading is not the recipient then they are practicing bad
      netiquette. People should not access information that is not meant to be public or not meant for
      them to read.
      </blockquote>

      <b>9.  Don’t abuse your power</b>
      <blockquote> Some people have higher access online such as system administrators, developers or
      admins of Multi-user dungeons (MUDs), and experts in every office. Knowing more or having more access
      online does not give a person the right to abuse it. For example, system admins should never read
      private emails of employees.
      </blockquote>

      <b>10.  Be forgiving of other people’s mistakes</b>
      <blockquote> When someone makes a mistake online, whether misspelled words, grammatical errors,
      unnecessarily long answer or unintelligent questions, be kind about it. If one  decides to inform
      someone of his/her mistake, he or she must do it politely, and preferably by private email or
      messages rather than in public. It is also advised to think twice before reacting.
